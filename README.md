# Data_Base_Project_Media_Streaming_Service
This project consists of two phases.
In the first phase, the focus is on creating a well-structured Conceptual Database Design, including an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram and its corresponding UML diagram to illustrate the entities, constraints, and relationships among them.

In the second phase, I followed these steps to meet the project's requirements:

1.Logical Database Design
2.Schema Refinement and Normalization
3.Database Implementation Using SQL

For more details, you can explore the related directories, which contain files such as requirements, implementation, diagrams, and a comprehensive report on the process.
